<h2>
History - National Pen Company
</h2>
 <p>
Modern Mold and Tool was founded in New York in 1948. The founder, Al Liguori, a machinist by trade, made some of the first ball point pens ever produced in the U.S. His innovative designs were very popular and the company grew rapidly.
 
In 1966, at Liguori's direction, his brother-in-law Paul Stabile and his eldest son Tom started the current marketing and manufacturing company, National Pen Company. They began to produce and market personalized writing instruments. The Company later added other promotional items to its product line. In 1976, the operation was moved to San Diego, CA.
 
In 1982, National Pen purchased its largest competitor, U.S. Pencil and Stationery Company, located in Shelbyville, TN. At the same time, the Liguoris acquired Perfect Mailing Service and also Perfect Pen and Stationery Co., LTD., a Canadian mail order company.
 
From 1986 to 1988, manufacturing operations were consolidated at the Shelbyville plant and Pluma Nacional was established in Tijuana, Mexico to handle labor-intensive operations and two international companies were formed. Stag Caribe was established in Puerto Rico to produce calendars and printed products, while National Pen Ltd. established an operation in Ireland and began mail order sales to European markets. Finger Prints of California, Inc. was formed and does business as National Design Corporation to specialize in the growing premium and souvenir market.
 
In 2007 Atlas Pen and Pencil of Florida was acquired.
 
Today, the Company uses telemarketing and mail order as well as internet to reach virtually every country with established postal and telephone systems. The Company manufactures and assembles many of its products, allowing it to control exceptional quality and service through its dedicated workforce. The balance of its sales comes from selected vendors who drop ship to the companies' customers. Licensing agreements have enabled National Design Corporation to provide personalized promotional items to national football, basketball, baseball, and hockey leagues, plus other well-known corporate customers.<p>
